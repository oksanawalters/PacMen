## Description
This Project is an interactive web page that populates PacMan faces and makes them bounce around the screen. When you click on "Add PacMan" a face appears and when you click "Start Game" it starts moving. The more you click on those buttons the more faces appear and the faster they move.

## How to Run
Please follow this [link](https://oksanawalters.github.io/PacMen/) to test it yourself. When the page is loaded click on "Add PacMan" and "Start Game".

## Future Improvements
This project can be improved by adding additional features, such as making each PacMan a different color.
